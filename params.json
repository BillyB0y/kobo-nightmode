Works only on the eInk series!","body":"kobo-nightmode\r\n==============\r\n\r\nA tiny hack to read white-on-black on Kobo ebook readers. Works only on the eInk series:\r\n+ Kobo Glo\r\n+ Kobo Touch\r\n+ Kobo Aura HD\r\n+ Kobo Mini\r\n\r\nSince the update to firmware 2.6+ Kobo has moved to hardware float proccessing, \r\nrequiring a new toolchain and partly breaking binary compatibility with older software. Currently this hack still works on  firmwares below 2.6, but it is highly recommended to upgrade.\r\nIf you need help or find a bug, check the [mobileread thread](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=212162), or create an issue on github.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nThere are two ways to contol nightmode:\r\n+ Long-press the LIGHT / HOME button on your device to toggle\r\n+ Write into the `/tmp/invertScreen` fifo-interface\r\n  + Send `y` to set nightmode to ON\r\n  + Send `n` to set nightmode to OFF\r\n  + Send `t` to toggle\r\n\r\nA sample script to toggle is provided in `extra/nightmode.sh`.\r\nAs the Kobo Mini has no physical buttons, the fifo-interface is currently the only way to control nightmode when running and thus, \r\nrelies on external tools such as:\r\n+ [Kobo Tweaks](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=206180), maintained by ah- (currently not available for 2.6+)\r\n+ [KoboLauncher](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=201632), maintained by sergeyvl12\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n-------------\r\nThe configuration file called `nightmode.ini` is located in your `.kobo` folder:\r\n```ini\r\n# config file for kobo-nightmode\r\n\r\n[state]\r\ninvertActiveOnStartup = no      # yes / no\r\nretainStateOverRestart = yes    # yes / no\r\n\r\n[control]\r\nlongPressDurationMS = 800       # time in milliseconds to toggle (1000 = 1 second)\r\n```\r\nIf `retainStateOverRestart` is activated, the value of `invertActiveOnStartup` will modified to reflect the current state.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nIn the installer/uninstaller directories, two `KoboRoot.tgz` files are provided for automatic installation and removal.\r\nSimply copy one of them into the .kobo folder on your device, safely remove, and wait for the reboot to finish.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n------------\r\nThis hack works by intercepting and modifying screen-update requests on-the-fly from the main reader application. \r\nThis is accomplished by interposing the `ioctl()` function using LD_PRELOAD.\r\nTherefore `/etc/init.d/rcS` has to be modified to start `nickel`, the main app with the `screenInv.so` dynamic library.\r\n\r\nCompile for yourself\r\n--------------------\r\nAll you need can be found in Kobo's [Kobo-Reader](https://github.com/kobolabs/Kobo-Reader) repository:\r\n+ An linux tarball for the imx507 platform\r\n+ The gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf toolchain to compile\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n+ Nicolas Devillard and others, for the [iniParser](http://github.com/ndevilla/iniparser) library\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
